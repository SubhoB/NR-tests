Numerical Relativity Examples
================

If you add things to the code that you think will be helpful to other people, like documenting the code etc, please add them to the `master` branch. Otherwise, keep the changes in a custom branch (e.g., `riccardo`) to avoid damage.

The example codes here were originally written by Luis Lehner (Perimeter Institute), Matt Choptuik and Franz Pretorius (Princeton) unless otherwise noted.
