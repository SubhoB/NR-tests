Numerical Relativity Examples
================

If you add things to the code that you think will be helpful to other people, like documenting the code etc, please add them to the `master` branch. Otherwise, keep the changes in a custom branch (e.g., `riccardo`) to avoid damage.

The example codes here were originally written by [Luis Lehner](https://www.perimeterinstitute.ca/people/luis-lehner) (Perimeter Institute), [Matt Choptuik](http://laplace.physics.ubc.ca/People/matt/) and [Franz Pretorius](http://physics.princeton.edu/~fpretori/) (Princeton) unless otherwise noted.



# simplewave

Plane wave confined in *x = 7 .. 9*. Reflexive boundary conditions. Flat spacetime.
